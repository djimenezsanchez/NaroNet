# NaroNet: objective-based learning of the tumor microenvironment from multiplex imaging.
Trained only with patient-level labels, NaroNet quantifies the phenotypes, neighborhoods, and neighborhood interactions that have the highest influence on the predictive task. This is the python implementation as described in our [*paper*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05385).
